# Game Concept
The Apple Pie App is a word-guessing game where the player has a limited number of guesses to identify the letters in a hidden word. Each incorrect guess causes an apple to drop from the apple tree. The objective is to guess the word before all the apples fall.

# Part 1: Interface
The app's design features an apple tree image at the top of the screen, which changes when incorrect letters are inputted. Below the tree, there is a full keyboard layout for inputting guesses. The word to be guessed is displayed beneath the keyboard, with correct letters filling in as they are guessed. At the bottom, a score tracker displays the number of wins and losses.

# Part 2: Beginning a Game
A Swift file has been created to control the image updates based on whether the guessed letters are correct or incorrect.

# Part 3: Game State
Code has been added to manage the game's progression, updating both the game state and the user interface when buttons are tapped.

# Part 4: Reveal Word
The code has been enhanced to display correctly guessed letters in the appropriate spaces in the word at the bottom of the screen.

# Part 5: Win/Loss
A restart feature has been coded, allowing players to start a new game after either guessing the word correctly or running out of guesses.
